== Frequently asked questions ==

= I got problem with Instagram =

It's a known issue due to Instagram. Twitter said it recently : Users are experiencing issues with viewing Instagram photos on Twitter. Issues include cropped images.This is due to Instagram disabling its Twitter cards integration, and as a result, photos are being displayed using a pre-cards experience.
So, when users click on Tweets with an Instagram link, photos appear cropped.

= Plugin is fine but Twitter cards doesn't appear in my tweets =

1. Make sure you correctly fulfilled fields in option page according to [Twitter documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards "Twitter cards documentation")
2. Be careful with your robots.txt and put some rules to allow Twitter to fetch your website :

`
	User-agent: Twitterbot
	Disallow:
`

If it still doesn't work please open a thread on support.

= The plugin generates a lot of images (different sizes) =

I can be a problem when you work with HD and/or a lot of images.

**How do I use the custom fields option?**

Basically you provide your custom field keys in plugin option page and then it will grab datas.

= Problème avec Instagram =
C'est un problème connu. Cela vient d'Instagram lui-même qui préfère que ses utilisateurs partagent les photos chez lui plutôt que sur Twitter. Instagram a supprimé ses Twitter Cards.

= Le plugin marche mais je n'obtiens pas de Twitter Cards dans mes tweets =

1. Assurez-vous bien d'avoir rempli correctement les champs dans la page d'options suivant <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards" title="Twitter cards documentation">la documentation Twitter</a>
2. Attention avec le fichier robots.txt, vous devez autoriser le robot de Twitter à crawler votre site:

`
	User-agent: Twitterbot
	Disallow:
`

Si cela ne marche toujours pas SVP ouvrez un topic sur le support.

= Le plugin génère beaucoup trop de fichiers images =

Cela peut poser problème si vous travaillez avec de la HD et/ou beaucoup d'images. Vous pouvez donc utiliser un plugin qui va effacer les fichiers images non utilisés.

= Comment utiliser l'option custom fields? =

Il suffit de renseigner les clés de vos custom fields en page d'option et le plugin s'occupera de récupérer les datas correspondantes.
